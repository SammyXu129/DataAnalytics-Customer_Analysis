# Customer Analytics and Experimental Test

## Project Background
This is the Quantium Data Analytics project from Forage. The client wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. And  then test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data driven recommendation to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores. The [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jia.xu4667/viz/quantium_project_report/Dashboard1) could be found here.

## Summary of Insights

**Overall Sales Trend**: 
- The number of chip sales has remained relatively consistent over the last one year from July 2018 July to July 2019; a noticebale increase occured in the week leading up to the Christmas.

**Customer segmentation**:
- Older and Young Family shoppers purchase the highest avg units per transaction, indicative of impulsive buying behavior.
- Sales have primarily been driven by three customer segments: Budget - older families, Mainstream - young singles/couples, and Mainstream - retirees shoppers. The notable increase in chip spending for these segments is attributed to their larger population compared to other buyer groups.
- A particularly noteworthy insight is that Mainstream - young singles and couples are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips than the rest of the population.
- The Category Manager may consider strategically placing Tyrrells and smaller chip packs in discretionary spaces frequented by young singles and couples. 

**Experimental Test**: 

- The control store is constructed to reflect performance of the trial store rather than the average of other stores; from Feb to May the trial store outperformed the control store highlighting the success of the new store layout
